- 👋 Hi, I’m @C0deEnthusiast
- 👀 I’m interested in (aside from coding) archery, eight-ball, hiking, anime, philosophy, and video games. For video games, I'm an avid player of Warframe,
Battlefield V, Call of Duty (especially BO4), etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, JavaScript, fencing, and how to sleep.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mini projects (i.e. password generators, countdown/timers, etc). I will probably expand this later.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Will be fixing that soon.
